  <p>How rude, let me tell you a bit about myself before myself as you look around. Bellow is a little list of facts about myself. </p>
    <ol>
      <li>I was born in 1998. Funny thing is i was born in Michigain, but i grew up in Marlyand for about 9-years of my life. didn't come back to Michigain until about 2016.</li> </br>
      <li>I'm a gym rat. I've been working about for about three years now. I go three times a week and try to eat clean as best as i can.</li> </br>
      <li>I am also a artist in my free time. I have been drawing for as long as i can recall and have a few sketch books full of my work and designs.</li>
    </ol>
